# Upside Down Escape

The Upside Down: Multiplayer Survival

A real-time, server-authoritative cooperative game built with Python (asyncio, websockets) and pygame. Players must coordinate to collect waffles and evade a growing "Mind Flayer" entity while navigating L-shaped obstacles. Includes implementation of client-side entity interpolation and simulated network latency (200ms) for resilience testing.
